## 👨‍💻 About The Project

This project pushes the boundaries of what is possible with **Streamlit**. Usually used for data dashboards, I hijacked the component system to build a desktop environment with a working Window Manager, Taskbar, and stateful applications.

It uses a unique combination of **Python** (backend logic/state) and **HTML/CSS/JS Injection** (frontend rendering) to create draggable, resizable, and interactive windows that persist state across re-runs.

### ✨ Features
*   **Desktop Environment:** A draggable, resizable Window Manager system.
*   **Start Menu:** Functional search and pinned apps.
*   **Taskbar:** Dynamic app docking and clock.
*   **State Management:** Apps remember their history and window position.

### 📦 Included Apps
1.  **Terminal:** A stateful command line interface. Supports `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `echo`, `neofetch`, `matrix`, and more.
2.  **API Tester:** A robust "Postman-lite" tool to test REST APIs with method selection (GET, POST, etc.) and JSON formatting.
3.  **Calculator:** Fully functional standard calculator.
4.  **Notepad:** Simple text editor.
5.  **Calendar, Clock & Weather:** Utility widgets.
